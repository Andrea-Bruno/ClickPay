# Crypto Asset Resources

This folder hosts configurable metadata (JSON) and optional raster icons (PNG) used by the ClickPay wallet experience.

## Icon Recommendations

- Icons should follow the `<code>.png` naming convention (for example `sol.png`).
- When possible, source artwork from the open-source pack at:
  https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/tree/master/128/white
- Copy the desired PNG locally before committing so the app can bundle the asset.

## Disclaimer

Third-party icons are provided for convenience only. Ensure that you review their terms of use and confirm they are appropriate for your distribution channels. ClickPay does not claim ownership over external artwork and you remain responsible for compliance with branding guidelines of each network.
